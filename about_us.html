        Established in Bend Oregon in 2012. Ladder Top Industries was conceived by Tim Harris after twenty years of working with ladders and scaffolding on residential housing construction projects. Noticing a large drop in productivity when the work involved climbing up (and down) ladders and scaffolding, Tim began trying to come up with solutions to these challenges.  Soon after, the first in line air tool hook was invented. After refining the tool and applying for patents LTI was ready to incorporate and go into production. The "RAFTERCLAW" is the flagship product of LTI.   This is an inline hook fitting that allows a worker to easily plug a tool hook on to any pneumatic tool. The hook can stay on the air hose or be taken off for ground level work. It works on almost any secure surface or fastening point.

         Donovan Mahoney joined Tim early on to job test the product and refine the design. They joined forces to try to provide the safest and most productive tools and ladder systems possible.  Ladder Top Industries mission is to increase both safety and productivity when dealing with ladders and heights. With these goals always in mind, Ladder Top Industries (LTI) is dedicated to provide the best, most dependable AMERICAN MADE products.   "Rafterclaw" is the first item offered by LTI.  We are looking forward to providing a full line of products and ladder systems. There are many more Ideas already in the lineup.
